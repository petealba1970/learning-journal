# What I learned about text editors
- There are basic editors that come with Windows and MacOs
- Other editors can be used that highlight text and make coding easier by checking for syntax errors ans allowing us to change the colors of text and background
- Choosing and editor is a a personal choice based on what works best for the individual
- many third party editors also include managers, compilers and debuggers and they are known as IDE's (integrated development environment)
