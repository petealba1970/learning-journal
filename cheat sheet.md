# What I learned about text editors
- There are basic editors that come with Windows and MacOs
- Other editors can be used that highlight text and make coding easier by checking for syntax errors ans allowing us to change the colors of text and background
- Choosing and editor is a a personal choice based on what works best for the individual
- many third party editors also include managers, compilers and debuggers and they are known as IDE's (integrated development environment)
-PWD
- ls lists the current directory
- ls -a shows hidden files
- ls -l shows if file is writeable
- ls -la shows writeable and hidden files
- rm <filename> brackets not needed but removes file
- mv moves file
- git add <filename> stages for commit 
-  git commit -m "why message" saves a local snapshot 
- git push or git push origin master pushes
