# What I learned about html
- knowing the audience is important in building a site
- we should cater the site to our visitors needs
- using site maps and wireframes helps us to organize the page(s)
- we can use design layout to priortize features
- visual hierarchy is a tool used to organize the content as well
- Using design navigation properly can give the visitor more relevant info for the product or service
