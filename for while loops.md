- We can compare values of a script with our expectation of what it should be, this is referred to as evaluating a condition
- We can use < > and = separately or in combination for specific comparisons, ie: A>B or B<A or B>=A
- Comparing usually returns a result of true or false
- It is even possible to evaluate multiple comparisons
- comparing with && looks to see if both are true: ((5 < 2) && (2 >=3))
- || comparison looks for one true ((2 < 5) || (2 < 1))
- ! takes a value and inverts it. : !true returns false
- Loops allow us to repeat a code block until certain conditions are met ex: for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)      
- This is followed by the code to execute during thge loop; ex: {document.write(i);}
