*What I learned about css*
- CSS allows to style our pages in an external file or inside our HTML
- We use curly braces for declaration outside of the selector
- this file can be used to style mutiple pages in a similar manner
- we can style many ways including the color sheme
- to style with color in an element we set RGB values, hex codes or color names
- we can use background color to color inside the elements
- we can use RGB values to manipulate the color
- other things such as hue, saturation and brightness can also be changed
- contrast is important in making the page readable
- opacity and rgba can also be used to further enhance colors
- Hsl is a newer way to effect hue, saturation and lightness
