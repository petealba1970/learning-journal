# What I learned about Markdown:

- A) What does markdown do?
-    1.Like CSS, it allows us to style these features usingf simpler commands:
-        a Display of documents
-        b Formatting of text (size, font)
-        c creating lists
- B) Markdown can used in conjunction with Github
     1. Github allows us to share our code or borrow code.
         a Github has controls which can be used in addition to markdown controls.
